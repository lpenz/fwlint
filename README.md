# fwlint

fwlint is a static analyser for rules of firewalls distributed in a network

This is the *legacy* branch. It has my master thesis on the subject, along with
the original haskell prototype
([compiled PDF](http://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/22813)).

Be warned that the haskell code here is very old, and doesn't have production quality.
I even had to create a Debian Squeeze container to be able to run it, as the
newer versions of GHC no longer support the extensions I used at that time.
